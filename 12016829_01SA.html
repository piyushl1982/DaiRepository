<p><strong>InfraLab Series 9 Rapid At Line Food Analyzer – for the Measurement of Moisture Content</strong></p><p>Designed for use in a manufacturing environment or the laboratory, the InfraLab is supplied in a robust, hygienic polyurethane housing, to provide a fast, safe, non-contacting, non-destructive and highly accurate measurement of the presented samples. Each InfraLab Series 9 features:</p><ul><li>High Speed Digital Signal Processing (DSP) with 1MHz Signal Sampling</li><li>Bright High-definition (10inch) Touch Screen User Interface with intuitive graphical displays</li><li>Precision spectrometer with NDC’s patented internal reference detection for optimum stability</li><li>Applications-engineered Measurement Algorithms with NDC’s factory pre-calibration and no routine re-calibration requirements</li><li>Damage Mitigation System with automatic gauge shutdown to protect against power overload or excessive temperature</li><li>On-board memory for data storage for up to 100,000 product samples</li><li>Advanced Diagnostic Functions with warning signals and auto-archiving</li><li>Sapphire Viewing window with full-surface Automatic Window Contamination Monitor</li><li>Auto-activated sample turntable for optimal sample presentation</li><li>Multiple user log-ins (up to 200), each with configurable security levels</li><li>Internal Gauge Check Function  – quickly validates Analyzer</li><li>Integral Calibration Tool for performance management and InfraLab Manager Software for Set-up, Trending and Logging</li><li>Advanced on-screen diagnostics</li></ul><p>The InfraLab is designed to replace routine gravimetric or wet chemical moisture content analysis methods and is ideal for users who need to process multiple samples on a daily basis. Ease of use and convenience are enhanced by the following:</p><ul><li>Rapid analysis with results in just 10 seconds</li><li>Minimal sample preparation and no special operator skills required</li><li>Automatic sample detection feature</li><li>Alarms for “bad sample presentation” and “out of specification” sample</li><li>Automatic recording and display of measurement value(s), including time &amp; date stamp and operator ID</li><li>Audit logging - any  changes to InfraLab settings are time &amp; date stamped and archived</li><li>Bar Code Reader compatibility for product selection (reader not supplied)</li><li>6 x strong plastic sample bowls (3 shallow and 3 deep) are included (other sample presentation arrangements available – see InfraLab brochure)</li></ul><p><br /> The multi-lingual operator software is easy to use and once one of the administrator-configured product measurement files is selected, there is no further need to touch the screen. The on-board memory stores measurement values for up to 10,000 samples, which can be easily extracted to a USB Memory Stick in CSV format for importing into Microsoft Excel or in a format suitable for importing into NDC’s InfraLab Manager Data Management and Calibration Optimization software (included). Where required LIMS network connectivity is available via Ethernet (at additional cost).</p>The easy-to-clean housing is sealed to IP65 and operates in an ambient temperature range of 0-50 Deg. C. InfraLab Series 9 accepts a universal power input (80-260V – 50-60Hz) and complies fully with the relevant European Standards including EN61326 relating to industrial and controlled electromagnetic environments and is CE marked and certified.
